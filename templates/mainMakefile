## This Makefile was created on $DATE by Luke Johnston for the project
## ${ProjectDir}.  Running this Makefile will run the analysis files
## in SAS and R to create the output files in the output directory.
## Before submitting the paper to a Journal or writing up the final
## version of the manuscript, type "make" or "make all" to create
## up-to-date output files, figures, and the reports.

### Variable Definitions ###
SHELL := /bin/sh # Tells make to use shell for shell commands
VPATH = scripts/functions dataset scripts # Tells make to search these directories for files
OBJ = variables.lst analysis.lst analysis.Rout # Object files to be created

all : refresh clean $(OBJ)

variables.lst : variables.sas
	sas $<

analysis.lst : analysis.sas
	sas $< # The "$<" = use the first dependency, in this case analysis.sas

analysis.Rout : analysis.R
	R CMD BATCH $<

# Include a rule for running knitr, and the latex files
# can call other makefiles using "$(MAKE) -C ./report/make"

.PHONY : refresh # To run this rule, type into the terminal "make refresh"
